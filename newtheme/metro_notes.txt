The process to happen:

	-User enters a card number/PIN
	-Javascript validation:
		-card is 14 digits and numeric
		
	
	-submits card number to DB (javascript)
		-via AJAX, gets the library name.
		-If valid, post this information to the next page
		-else show error saying library is unknown or card number is incorrect
		
	


	INSERT into user table when the first member library is joined
	
	has:
		generate hash of user info:
		userid is card number
		make a hash of anything than can change
		pin, name, address, province, postalcode, email, phone, isvalid, isgoodstanding, isresident, isreciprocal

Signup page:
------------

We require the following information:
	-card number
	-pin?
	-first name
	-last name
	-street
	-city
	-province
	-postalcode
	-email
	-phone
	-privilege_expires
	-hash
	-home library index

Or... maybe I really just need the hash, home library index, firstname, lastname, 
	
The first time a user clicks on "sign up" we create a record for that user, and create an entry in the membership table
	
	
Welcome Page
-------------
	-When the user signs in, we should
		-check if the account already exists.
		IF YES
		-check the hash of user data against the db.
	If the account exists and the hash is the same, we just go straight to the signup page.
	If it exists but the hash is different, then we show the welcome page with different text and an update button.
